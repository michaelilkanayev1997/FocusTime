## Description

FocusTime is a React Native mobile application designed to help users concentrate on specific tasks for a set period. This app serves as a simple tool for focusing on tasks, notifying users upon completion, and managing completed tasks.

- **Focus Timer:** Allows users to set a specific duration to focus on a task.
- **Task Completion:** Notifies users with a phone vibration upon task completion.
- **Task Management:** Includes a list of completed tasks for reference.

## Installation

To run this app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a simulator or physical device using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
